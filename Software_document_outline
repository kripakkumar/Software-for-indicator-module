# Software Document: Indicators Control over Mobile Phones (using BLE Protocol)

## 1. High-Level Architecture
- Base software drivers for UART, GPIO, PWM, Timer, Scheduler in C.
- Application software developed in MATLAB Simulink for indicator logic.
- BLE module integration to control indicators remotely via mobile app.

## 2. Software Requirements Specification
- Detect 1-second long presses on Left, Right buttons.
- Toggle respective indicators.
- Activate hazard light on simultaneous button press.
- LEDs toggle ON-OFF-ON every 300 ms using PWM.
- Publish status over UART.
- 100 ms scheduler for task execution.
- BLE commands to control indicators remotely.

## 3. BLE Control Integration
- BLE service with characteristics for left, right, and hazard indicators.
- Mobile app sends commands via BLE.
- MCU updates indicator states accordingly.

## 4. Testing and Validation
- Functional testing of buttons and LED toggling.
- UART log validation.
- BLE control functionality test.

## 5. Future Work
- Complete BLE mobile app integration.
- Add feedback from indicators to mobile app.
- Add security features for BLE communication.
