# Hardware Setup Instructions

## Components
- Microcontroller board (STM32, Arduino, PIC, etc.)
- Two push buttons
- Two LEDs with current limiting resistors (~220Î©)
- UART TTL converter
- Jumper wires

## Connections

### Buttons
- Connect one terminal of each button to GPIO input pin.
- Connect other terminal to GND.
- Enable internal pull-up resistors in software.

### LEDs
- Connect LED anode to PWM-enabled GPIO pins via resistor.
- Connect LED cathode to GND.

### UART
- Connect UART TX and RX pins to UART TTL converter.
- Connect UART TTL converter to PC serial port.

### Power
- Ensure microcontroller board is powered as per specifications.
